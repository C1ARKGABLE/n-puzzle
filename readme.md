# n-puzzle in Go
This is a simple solution to the n-puzzle problem in Go.

### Why n-puzzle problem?
For a class assignment, we are working with simple search algorithms. This is an implementation of A* with manhattan distance from solution as the scoring heuristic. After learning how A* works, we've be asked to implement it in a coding language of our own choice.

### Why Go?
Honestly, we could have picked any programming language (Like, all the way down to Assembly... It'd be fast ðŸ–¥ðŸ’¨). We were curious about how Go works, and so this was our first decent sized project in Go. So, why not Go?
