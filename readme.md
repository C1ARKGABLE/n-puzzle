# n-puzzle in Go
This is a simple solution to the [n-puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-puzzle) problem in [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)).

### Why n-puzzle problem?
For a class assignment, we are working with simple search algorithms. This is an implementation of [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) with [manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance) from solution as the [scoring heuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)). After learning how A* works, we've be asked to implement it in a coding language of our own choice.

### Why Go?
Honestly, we could have picked [any programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages) (Like, all the way down to [assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)... It'd be fast ðŸ–¥ðŸ’¨). We were curious about how Go works, and this problem is the perfect test case for learning. So, why not Go?
